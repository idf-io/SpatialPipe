# SpatialPipe: Systematic standardization and framework integration of public spatial-omics datasets for cell-cell communication analysis

Preprocessing pipeline implementation of some public spatial omics datasets which will be used for a shared project we have in collaboration with Omer Bayraktar group from Sanger institute at UK. There is of course some flexibility in defining the actual project, but the bottom-line is, the project is gonna be about low-level analysis of spatial omics data

**IMPORTANT**
- Objective of project: create code that will be reusable by the group
- Focus on reusability, clarity and documentation
