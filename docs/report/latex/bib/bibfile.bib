	abstract = {Cell–cell communication is a fundamental process that shapes biological tissue. Historically, studies of cell–cell communication have been feasible for one or two cell types and a few genes. With the emergence of single-cell transcriptomics, we are now able to examine the genetic profiles of individual cells at unprecedented scale and depth. The availability of such data presents an exciting opportunity to construct a more comprehensive description of cell–cell communication. This review discusses the recent explosion of methods that have been developed to infer cell–cell communication from non-spatial single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, two promising technologies that have complementary strengths and limitations. We propose several avenues to propel this rapidly expanding field forward in meaningful ways.},

The expansion of protein–protein interaction databases and recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled routine analyses of intercellular signalling from gene expression measurements of bulk and single-cell data sets. In particular, ligand–receptor pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated expression of their cognate genes.

Many tools have been developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we created a framework, available at https://github.com/saezlab/ligrec\_decoupler, to facilitate a comparative assessment of methods for inferring cell-cell communication from single cell transcriptomics data and then compared 15 resources and 6 methods. We found few unique interactions and a varying degree of overlap among the resources, and observed uneven coverage in terms of pathways and biological categories. We analysed a colorectal cancer single cell RNA-Seq dataset using all possible combinations of methods and resources. We found major differences among the highest ranked intercellular interactions inferred by each method even when using the same resources. The varying predictions lead to fundamentally different biological interpretations, highlighting the need to benchmark resources and methods.},

In this study, we developed an approach to characterize the metabolic regulome of single cells together with their phenotypic identity. The method, termed single-cell metabolic regulome profiling (scMEP), quantifies proteins that regulate metabolic pathway activity using high-dimensional antibody-based technologies. We employed mass cytometry (cytometry by time of flight, CyTOF) to benchmark scMEP against bulk metabolic assays by reconstructing the metabolic remodeling of in vitro-activated naive and memory CD8+ T cells. We applied the approach to clinical samples and identified tissue-restricted, metabolically repressed cytotoxic T cells in human colorectal carcinoma. Combining our method with multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF), we uncovered the spatial organization of metabolic programs in human tissues, which indicated exclusion of metabolically repressed immune cells from the tumor–immune boundary. Overall, our approach enables robust approximation of metabolic and functional states in individual cells.},

Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have emerged as a revolutionary method to reveal cellular heterogeneity with unprecedented resolution. This offers a great opportunity to explore cell–cell communication in tissues systematically and comprehensively, and to further identify signaling mechanisms driving cell fate decisions and shaping tissue phenotypes. Using gene expression information from single-cell transcriptomics, several computational tools have been developed for inferring cell–cell communication, greatly facilitating analysis and interpretation. However, in single-cell transcriptomics, spatial information of cells is inherently lost. Given that most cell signaling events occur within a limited distance in tissues, incorporating spatial information into cell–cell communication analysis is critical for understanding tissue organization and function. Spatial transcriptomics provides spatial location of cell subsets along with their gene expression, leading to new directions for leveraging spatial information to develop computational approaches for cell–cell communication inference and analysis. These computational approaches have been successfully applied to uncover previously unrecognized mechanisms of intercellular communication within various contexts and across organ systems, including the skin, a formidable model to study mechanisms of cell–cell communication due to the complex interactions between the different cell populations that comprise it. Here, we review emergent cell–cell communication inference tools using single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics, and highlight the biological insights gained by applying these computational tools to exploring cellular communication in skin development, homeostasis, disease and aging, as well as discuss future potential research avenues.},

Notably, CS knockdown cells exhibited severe defects in respiratory activity and marked decreases in ATP production, but great increases in glycolytic metabolism. This malignant progression was due to activation of EMT-related regulators; altered energy metabolism resulted from deregulation of the p53/TIGAR and SCO2 pathways. This phenotypic change was completely reversed by p53 reactivation via treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 or co-knockdown of E3 ligase HDM2 and partially suppressed by ATP treatment. This study directly links the Warburg effect to tumor malignancy via induction of the EMT phenotype.},

To comprehensively document spatial gene expression technologies and data-analysis methods, we present a curated review of literature on spatial transcriptomics dating back to 1987, along with a thorough analysis of trends in the field, such as usage of experimental techniques, species, tissues studied, and computational approaches used. Our Review places current methods in a historical context, and we derive insights about the field that can guide current research strategies.

	abstract = {Spatial Transcriptomics is an emerging technology that adds spatial dimensionality and tissue morphology to the genome-wide transcriptional profile of cells in an undissociated tissue. Integrating these three types of data creates a vast potential for deciphering novel biology of cell types in their native morphological context. Here we developed innovative integrative analysis approaches to utilise all three data types to first find cell types, then reconstruct cell type evolution within a tissue, and search for tissue regions with high cell-to-cell interactions. First, for normalisation of gene expression, we compute a distance measure using morphological similarity and neighbourhood smoothing. The normalised data is then used to find clusters that represent transcriptional profiles of specific cell types and cellular phenotypes. Clusters are further sub-clustered if cells are spatially separated. Analysing anatomical regions in three mouse brain sections and 12 human brain datasets, we found the spatial clustering method more accurate and sensitive than other methods. Second, we introduce a method to calculate transcriptional states by pseudo-space-time (PST) distance. PST distance is a function of physical distance (spatial distance) and gene expression distance (pseudotime distance) to estimate the pairwise similarity between transcriptional profiles among cells within a tissue. We reconstruct spatial transition gradients within and between cell types that are connected locally within a cluster, or globally between clusters, by a directed minimum spanning tree optimisation approach for PST distance. The PST algorithm could model spatial transition from non-invasive to invasive cells within a breast cancer dataset. Third, we utilise spatial information and gene expression profiles to identify locations in the tissue where there is both high ligand-receptor interaction activity and diverse cell type co-localisation. These tissue locations are predicted to be hotspots where cell-cell interactions are more likely to occur. We detected tissue regions and ligand-receptor pairs significantly enriched compared to background distribution across a breast cancer tissue. Together, these three algorithms, implemented in a comprehensive Python software stLearn, allow for the elucidation of biological processes within healthy and diseased tissues.},

Utilizing EMBRACE we isolate, transcriptionally analyze, and build a cell-cell communication map of the developing mouse brain. We identify 1,710 unique ligand-receptor interactions between neural, endothelial, mural, and microglial cells in silico and experimentally confirm the APOE-LDLR, APOE-LRP1, VTN-KDR, and LAMA4-ITGB1 interactions in the E14.5 brain.

	abstract = {CD4+ T cells orchestrate adaptive immunity to circulating malaria parasites; yet cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms controlling Th1 and Tfh differentiation in the spleen remain to be fully defined in vivo. Here, using a murine model of CD4-dependent immunity, we tested if Slide-seqV2, a spatial transcriptomic method with near single-cell resolution, could determine the locations of multiple CD4+ T cell subsets and potentially interacting cellular partners in the spleen during infection. Firstly, Slide-seqV2 readily mapped splenic cellular structure and microanatomical change during infection. Next, computational integration with scRNA-seq reference datasets of splenocytes, stromal cells, and specifically of polyclonal CD4+ T cells and B cells, mapped the relative locations of multiple cell-types within this dense tissue. scRNA-seq of B cells over time mapped emergence of germinal centre B cells, red pulp-located plasmablasts and atypical B cells, and uncovered a prolonged CD4+ T-cell-independent, follicular bystander B cell response marked by Sca-1 and Ly6C upregulation. scRNA-seq of activated, polyclonal CD4+ T cells revealed their similarity to our previous TCR transgenic models. Importantly, spatial analysis revealed polyclonal Th1 cells co-localised with CXCL9/10-producing monocytes in the red pulp, while polyclonal Tfh-like cells were located close to CXCL13-expressing B cell follicles, consistent with our previous CXCR3/CXCR5 competition model of Th1/Tfh bifurcation. CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of either or both CXCR3 and CXCR5 in naïve Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells had unexpectedly minor effects on Th1 differentiation in vivo. Instead, CXCR5 was essential for maximising clonal expansion, suggesting a role for splenic CXCL13+ cells in supporting CD4+ T cell proliferation in malaria. Thus, spatial transcriptomics at near single-cell resolution was feasible in densely packed secondary lymphoid tissue, providing multiple insights into mechanisms controlling splenic polyclonal CD4+ T cell and B cell differentiation during infection.
HighlightsSlide-seqV2 maps splenic microanatomy, including stromal and immune cell location.Bystander activation of all follicular B cells occurs in malaria, marked by Sca-1/Ly6C upregulation.Single naïve polyclonal CD4+ T cells differentiate mostly into Th1 and Tfh cells in malaria.Cell-cell colocalization analysis positions Th1 cells with monocytes in red pulp, and Tfh cells with Cxcl13+ B cell follicles.CXCR5, but not CXCR3, supports parasite-specific CD4+ T cell clonal expansion.},
