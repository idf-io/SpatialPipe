  abstract = {Understanding the predictions of a machine learning model can be as crucial as the model’s accuracy in many application domains. However, the black-box nature of most highly-accurate (complex) models is a major hindrance to their interpretability. To address this issue, we introduce the symbolic metamodeling framework — a general methodology for interpreting predictions by converting “black-box” models into “white-box” functions that are understandable to human subjects. A symbolic metamodel is a model of a model, i.e., a surrogate model of a trained (machine learning) model expressed through a succinct symbolic expression that comprises familiar mathematical functions and can be subjected to symbolic manipulation. We parameterize metamodels using Meijer G-functions — a class of complex-valued contour integrals that depend on real-valued parameters, and whose solutions reduce to familiar algebraic, analytic and closed-form functions for different parameter settings. This parameterization enables efficient optimization of metamodels via gradient descent, and allows discovering the functional forms learned by a model with minimal a priori assumptions. We show that symbolic metamodeling provides a generalized framework for model interpretation — many common forms of model explanation can be analytically derived from a symbolic metamodel.},

Historically, studies of cell–cell communication have been feasible for one or two cell types and a few genes. With the emergence of single-cell transcriptomics, we are now able to examine the genetic profiles of individual cells at unprecedented scale and depth. The availability of such data presents an exciting opportunity to construct a more comprehensive description of cell–cell communication. This review discusses the recent explosion of methods that have been developed to infer cell–cell communication from non-spatial single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, two promising technologies that have complementary strengths and limitations.

In whole or near-full transcriptome spatial techniques, spurious expression profiles are intermixed with those exhibiting an organized structure. To distinguish profiles with spatial patterns from the background noise, a metric that enables quantification of spatial structure is desirable. Current methods designed for similar purposes tend to be built around a framework of statistical hypothesis testing, hence we were compelled to explore a fundamentally different strategy.We propose an unexplored approach to analyze spatial transcriptomics data, simulating diffusion of individual transcripts to extract genes with spatial patterns. The method performed as expected when presented with synthetic data. When applied to real data, it identified genes with distinct spatial profiles, involved in key biological processes or characteristic for certain cell types. Compared to existing methods, ours seemed to be less informed by the genes’ expression levels and showed better time performance when run with multiple cores.Open-source Python package with a command line interface (CLI), freely available at https://github.com/almaan/sepal under an MIT licence.

Interacting cells can sense their mutual distance using combinations of ligand-receptor pairs, suggesting the existence of a spatial code, i.e., signals encoding spatial properties of cellular organization. However, this code driving and sustaining the spatial organization of cells remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions from the transcriptomes of the cell types across the whole body of a multicellular organism. As core of this framework, we introduce our tool cell2cell, which uses the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs to compute the potential for intercellular interactions, and we test it across the Caenorhabditis elegans' body. Leveraging a 3D atlas of C. elegans' cells, we also implement a genetic algorithm to identify the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells across the whole body. Validating the spatial code extracted with this strategy, the resulting intercellular distances are negatively correlated with the inferred cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, for selected cell-cell and ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm the communicatory behavior inferred with cell2cell and the genetic algorithm. Thus, our framework helps identify a code that predicts the spatial organization of cells across a whole-animal body.},

SVCA enables quantifying different dimensions of spatial variation and in particular quantifies the effect of cell-cell interactions on gene expression. In a breast cancer Imaging Mass Cytometry dataset, our model yields interpretable spatial variance signatures, which reveal cell-cell interactions as a major driver of protein expression heterogeneity. Applied to high-dimensional imaging-derived RNA data, SVCA identifies plausible gene families that are linked to cell-cell interactions. SVCA is available as a free software tool that can be widely applied to spatial data from different technologies.},

A collective optimal transport method is developed to handle complex molecular interactions and spatial constraints. Furthermore, we introduce downstream analysis tools to infer spatial signaling directionality and genes regulated by signaling using machine learning models. We apply COMMOT to simulation data and eight spatial datasets acquired with five different technologies to show its effectiveness and robustness in identifying spatial CCC in data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages.

To investigate how the context-dependent crosstalk of different cell types enables physiological processes to proceed, we developed CellPhoneDB, a novel repository of ligands, receptors and their interactions. In contrast to other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data. Here, we outline the structure and content of our repository, provide procedures for inferring cell–cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data and present a practical step-by-step guide to help implement the protocol.

CellPhoneDB v.2.0 is publicly available, both as code and as a user-friendly web interface; it can be used by both experts and researchers with little experience in computational genomics. In our protocol, we demonstrate how to evaluate meaningful biological interactions with CellPhoneDB v.2.0 using published datasets.

We applied the approach to clinical samples and identified tissue-restricted, metabolically repressed cytotoxic T cells in human colorectal carcinoma.

Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have emerged as a revolutionary method to reveal cellular heterogeneity with unprecedented resolution. This offers a great opportunity to explore cell–cell communication in tissues systematically and comprehensively, and to further identify signaling mechanisms driving cell fate decisions and shaping tissue phenotypes. Using gene expression information from single-cell transcriptomics, several computational tools have been developed for inferring cell–cell communication, greatly facilitating analysis and interpretation. However, in single-cell transcriptomics, spatial information of cells is inherently lost. Given that most cell signaling events occur within a limited distance in tissues, incorporating spatial information into cell–cell communication analysis is critical for understanding tissue organization and function. Spatial transcriptomics provides spatial location of cell subsets along with their gene expression, leading to new directions for leveraging spatial information to develop computational approaches for cell–cell communication inference and analysis. These computational approaches have been successfully applied to uncover previously unrecognized mechanisms of intercellular communication within various contexts and across organ systems, including the skin, a formidable model to study mechanisms of cell–cell communication due to the complex interactions between the different cell populations that comprise it. Here, we review emergent cell–cell communication inference tools using single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics, and highlight the biological insights gained by applying these computational tools to exploring cellular communication in skin development, homeostasis, disease and aging, as well as discuss future potential research avenues.},

  abstract = {Here, we present CellOracle, a computational tool that integrates single-cell transcriptome and epigenome profiles to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), critical regulators of cell identity. Leveraging inferred GRNs, we simulate gene expression changes in response to transcription factor (TF) perturbation, enabling network configurations to be interrogated in silico, facilitating their interpretation. We validate the efficacy of CellOracle to recapitulate known regulatory changes across hematopoiesis, correctly predicting the outcomes of well-characterized TF perturbations. Integrating CellOracle analysis with lineage tracing of direct reprogramming reveals distinct network configurations underlying different reprogramming failure modes. Furthermore, analysis of GRN reconfiguration along successful reprogramming trajectories identifies new factors to enhance target cell yield, uncovering a role for the AP-1 subunit Fos, with the hippo signaling effector, Yap1. Together, these results demonstrate the efficacy of CellOracle to infer and interpret cell-type-specific GRN configurations, at high-resolution, promoting new mechanistic insights into the regulation and reprogramming of cell identity.},

We demonstrate quantitative, full periodic table coverage across a five-log dynamic range, imaging 36 labeled antibodies simultaneously with histochemical stains and endogenous elements. We image fields of view up to 800 μm × 800 μm at resolutions down to 260 nm with sensitivities approaching single-molecule detection. We leverage these properties to interrogate intrapatient heterogeneity in tumor organization in triple-negative breast cancer, revealing regional variability in tumor cell phenotypes in contrast to a structured immune response. Given its versatility and sample back-compatibility, MIBI-TOF is positioned to leverage existing annotated, archival tissue cohorts to explore emerging questions in cancer, immunology, and neurobiology.},

Cell2location accounts for technical sources of variation and borrows statistical strength across locations, thereby enabling the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with higher sensitivity and resolution than existing tools. We assessed cell2location in three different tissues and show improved mapping of fine-grained cell types. In the mouse brain, we discovered fine regional astrocyte subtypes across the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the human lymph node, we spatially mapped a rare pre-germinal center B cell population. In the human gut, we resolved fine immune cell populations in lymphoid follicles.

Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cell’s expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here, we benchmark and enhance the use of matrix factorization to solve this problem. We show with simulations that a method we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including their relative contributions in each cell. To illustrate the insights this approach enables, we apply it to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets; cNMF refines cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and novel activity programs, including programs that may underlie a neurosecretory phenotype and synaptogenesis.},

  abstract = {Inference of cell-cell communication (CCC) from single-cell RNA-sequencing data is a powerful technique to uncover putative axes of multicellular coordination, yet existing methods perform this analysis at the level of the cell type or cluster, discarding single-cell level information. Here we present Scriabin – a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of CCC at single-cell resolution. We leverage multiple published datasets to show that Scriabin recovers expected CCC edges and use spatial transcriptomic data, genetic perturbation screens, and direct experimental manipulation of receptor-ligand interactions to validate that the recovered edges are biologically meaningful. We then apply Scriabin to uncover co-expressed programs of CCC from atlas-scale datasets, validating known communication pathways required for maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche and revealing species-specific communication pathways. Finally, we utilize single-cell communication networks calculated using Scriabin to follow communication pathways that operate between timepoints in longitudinal datasets, highlighting bystander cells as important initiators of inflammatory reactions in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to leverage single-cell resolution data maximally toward uncovering CCC circuitry and rich niche-phenotype relationships in health and disease.},

  abstract = {We present a penalized matrix decomposition (PMD), a new framework for computing a rank-K approximation for a matrix. We approximate the matrix X as , where dk, uk, and vk minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X, subject to penalties on uk and vk. This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L1-penalties on uk and vk, which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the PMD is applied using an L1-penalty on vk but not on uk, a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the “SCoTLASS” proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply this penalized CCA method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and DNA copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

  abstract = {Systematic interrogation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is key to the development of immunotherapies and the prediction of their clinical responses in cancers. Here, we perform deep single-cell RNA sequencing on 5,063 single T~cells isolated from peripheral blood, tumor, and adjacent normal tissues from six hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The transcriptional profiles of these individual cells, coupled with assembled T~cell receptor (TCR) sequences, enable us to identify 11 T~cell subsets based on their molecular and functional properties and delineate their developmental trajectory. Specific subsets such as exhausted CD8+ T~cells and Tregs are preferentially enriched and potentially clonally expanded in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we identified signature genes for each subset. One of the genes, layilin, is upregulated on activated CD8+ T~cells and Tregs and represses the CD8+ T~cell functions in~vitro. This compendium of transcriptome data provides valuable insights and a rich resource for understanding the immune landscape in cancers.},
